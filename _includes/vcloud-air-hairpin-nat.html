In most cases accessing a server on an internal network through the gateway is a simple matter of adding NAT rules to the Edge Gateway.
For example these rules would allow an <strong>external</strong> server to access an internal server through the gateway public ip.

DNAT   23.92.200.151 port 4242      &gt;&gt;  192.168.109.3  port 4242
SNAT   192.168.109.0/24                 &gt;&gt;  23.92.200.151
</p>

<h4><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Hairpin NAT Problem</span>:</h4>
But a confusing issue can occur when an server on the inside network tries to reach itself or another inside server by addressing the public ip on the gateway.

In the diagram above, 192.168.109.3 is a server on a vCloud Air Virtual Data Center
internal network and 23.92.200.151 is a public ip on the Gateway of the VDC.

Given the gateway rules above, let's test this scenario .

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Test</span>

Start Netcat on the inside server and have it listen on 192.168.109.3 port 4242 for connections.

$ nc -l 4242 &amp;

// From the inside server, we can reach the same server using the inside address 192.1.68.109.3
$ telnet 192.168.109.3 4242
— Connected Accepted

// From a server outside vCloud Air 50.4.227.75 we can reach through the gateway public ip to the inside server.
$ telnet 23.92.200.151 4242
— Connection Accepted

// But, from the inside server 192.168.109.3 to public ip outside we don’t get routed back in
$ telnet 23.92.200.151 4242
— Connection Refused

Whats Going on?
Why are all connections to 23.92.200.151 4242 not being routed to 192.168.109.3 4242 ?
<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Solutions:</span></h3>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Solve with a Local Host File Entry</span>

The simplest solution is do the lookup using a hostname instead of an ip.
Add an entry to the local server hosts file so the local address is used for inside destinations.

For example

In the /etc/hosts file add the line

myserver 192.168.109.3

When this entry exists on the local server, hostname resolution will find the local server address before any DNS resolution finds a the public ip of the gateway.

But sometimes its not possible to know the local address of all servers on the internal network.
This leads us to the second solution using the gateway.

In this solution we will add NAT rules to both the internal network and the Gateway external network.

Add identical DNAT and SNAT rules  to both networks.
<h4>Explanation:</h4>
With the new rules,
<ul>
	<li>Calls from an outside server to the gateway public ip - 50.4.227.75   calling   23.92.200.151  4242</li>
</ul>
When the packet below arrives at the 192.168.109.0 network
Rule #2 - Changes the destination address in the packet to 192.168.109.3 4242
Rule #4 - Not applied change since source is not 192.168.109.x  Src packet stays the same.
IP SRC:  50.4.227.75                       &gt;&gt;          IP SRC:  50.4.227.75
IP DST:   23.92.200.151  4242                       IP DST:  <span style="color: #3366ff;">192.168.109.3</span>  4242
<ul>
	<li>Calls from the inside server to gateway public ip  - 192.168.109.3   calling   23.92.200.151</li>
</ul>
When the packet below enters the 23.92.200.0 network

Rule #1 - Changes the Destination address in packet from 23.92.200.151 to 192.168.109.3
The packet never leaves the network.

Rule #3 - Changes the Source address from 192.168.109.3 to 23.92.200.151
Two tricky things here,  the packet looks like it came from outside, so responses will be sent back to the outside address. But DNAT rule #1 will route responses back to the  192.168.109.3)

IP SRC:  192.168.109.3                      &gt;&gt;      IP SRC:  <span style="color: #3366ff;">23.92.200.151</span>
IP DST:   23.92.200.151  4242                      IP DST:  <span style="color: #3366ff;">192.168.109.3</span> 4242

Additional DNAT rules will be required on both networks for all additional inside servers that will require inside access through the gateway public ip.
